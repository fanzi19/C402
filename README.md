    amount of memory:
    operating system:
    compiler used:

  *Lab Desktop:
    manufacturer:
    CPU type:

Part2(a):
Personal Laptop:
  *execution time:
    double value:
    integer value:

Lab desktop:
  *execution time:
    double value:
    integer value:

Summary: 

Performance ratio v.s. clock rate ratio:
*Personal Laptop:
  Unlike traditional Intel or AMD CPUs, the clock speed of the Apple M1 CPU is not a fixed value but dynamically adjusts based on workload and power management.
*Lab desktop:


Conclution: Based on the retail price of the two systems, which one is more cost effective (5)?




Part2(b):
Personal Laptop: 
  *execution time:
    double value:
    integer value:

Lab desktop:  
  *execution time:
    double value:
    integer value:



Question remark:
Is the performance ratio the same as the clock rate ratio of the two systems (5)? Explain. Based on the retail price of the two systems, which one is more cost effective (5)?

Make sure your work includes a description of the two systems (manufacturer, CPU type, amount of memory, operating system, etc.) and of the compiler used (5). Attach the source code, the tables with your time measurements for your work, and a link to your repository such that we can check-out the code, build, and execute (5).
